Judging from what I read from your brief, you're a startup looking to build something great. With that being said, you made mention of contributors making various kinds of contributions. I would like to know the various kinds of contributions you're willing to accept and see if I can be of help and make a meaningful contribution to your startup. Meeting remotely once a week is not going to be a problem. I see it as an avenue to brainstorm and review as team which is absolutely necessary.

Attached below are a few links to my projects. The first link is my most recent project (still in development) and the second link is my portfolio. Feel free to message me so we can discuss further.
